                <h3>1 Jul 2015 16:53  | <a class="tag" href="/blog/tag/apple.html">apple</a></h3>
                  <pre>I wanted to like Apple Music, I really really did.  I never really got into
Spotify but the hassle of finding new music is a constant problem for me.  As
you can see from my music page on this very website, I go through music at a
crazy rate.  I&#39;ve bought over 1500 songs from iTunes over the last few years
and only around 266 are still in my playlist.  Finding new music that I like is
a constant struggle and I generally resort to scraping sites like beatport.com,
phonica, blackmarket records etc looking for new stuff.

So today I tried the Apple Music free trial.

The first page was a load of bubbles with the names of musical genres in them.
You are apparently supposed to tap the ones you like, and double-tap the ones
you love.  Straight away there was a glaring problem - none of the genres were
the music I actually listen to.  99% of my collection is D&amp;B and dubstep.  The
closest approximations were &quot;dance&quot; or &quot;electronic&quot;, but I didn&#39;t really fancy
my chances much with those kind of vague categories.

But it gets worse..

In order to *remove* genres, as you&#39;re apparently supposed to do, you have to
hold your finger on them for 3 whole seconds WHILE THE FUCKING THING MOVES
AROUND UNDERNEATH IT!  Is Apple making some kind of very poor-taste joke?!

Finally, I managed to select both &quot;dance&quot; and &quot;electronic&quot;, disregard the rest,
and move to the next section.  Then I was presented with another set of bubbles
for 20 artists I&#39;ve never heard of.  Why it was presenting these instead of, oh
  I don&#39;t know, the artists I&#39;ve ACTUALLY BOUGHT MUSIC FROM, I have no idea.

After rejecting all of these I got another 20 artists that I barely care about.
The only two I even vaguely like were Prodigy and Nero.  After selecting these
two and killing the rest, I then found that there were no more artists and the
next button wouldn&#39;t do anything.  There was no obvious indication why (nice
one Apple!) but presumably I hadn&#39;t selected enough artists that I don&#39;t like
in order to continue.

At this point I decided fuck Apple Music in the teeth and wiped it from my
devices.  Why they would push artists you don&#39;t like or don&#39;t know on you when
they have your ENTIRE MUSIC COLLECTION in their cloud is very strange.  Why
should I have to select any artists at all?  They KNOW which artists I like
because I BOUGHT THEIR FUCKING MUSIC!

Perhaps they couldn&#39;t get those artists, the artists I actually like, to sign
up to the service.  In which case they should be smart enough to tell me
upfront &quot;Hey Mark, we don&#39;t have any of the artists you like in Apple Music at
the moment, still want to continue?&quot;

If they&#39;d done that, and not rolled out an absolutely ridiculous UI, I&#39;d just
be mildly disappointed rather than actually angry.

Apple Music is not worthy of the Apple brand.</pre>
